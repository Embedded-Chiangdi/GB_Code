## Mutex lock for Linux Thread Synchronization
Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as critical section.Processesâ€™ access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques.  
An example code of synchronization problems:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<string.h> 
#include<pthread.h> 
#include<stdlib.h> 
#include<unistd.h> 

pthread_t tid[2]; 
int counter; 

void* trythis(void *arg) 
{ 
	unsigned long i = 0; 
	counter += 1; 
	printf("\n Job %d has started\n", counter); 

	for(i=0; i<(0xFFFFFFFF);i++); 
	printf("\n Job %d has finished\n", counter); 

	return NULL; 
} 

int main(void) 
{ 
	int i = 0; 
	int error; 

	while(i < 2) 
	{ 
		error = pthread_create(&(tid[i]), NULL, &trythis, NULL); 
		if (error != 0) 
			printf("\nThread can't be created : [%s]", strerror(error)); 
		i++; 
	} 

	pthread_join(tid[0], NULL); 
	pthread_join(tid[1], NULL); 

	return 0; 
} 
```
The output is 
```
[jiangdi@example thread_prog]$ ./a.out

 Job 1 has started

 Job 2 has started

 Job 2 has finished

 Job 2 has finished

```
From the output we can see that the log `Job 2 has finished` is repeated twice.
